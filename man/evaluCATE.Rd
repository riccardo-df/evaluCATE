\description{
Evaluates the quality of CATEs estimates by estimating the best linear predictor (BLP) of the actual CATEs using the estimated
CATEs, the sorted group average treatment effects (GATES), and the rank-weighted average treatment effect (RATE) induced by
the estimated CATEs.
}
\details{
To estimate BLP, GATES, and RATEs, the user must provide observations on the outcomes, the treatment status, and the covariates of units in the whole sample, as well
as their estimated CATEs. Be careful, as although the CATEs must be estimated only with part of the sample (which we call the training sample), they must be predicted
on the whole sample \code{X} when passed in \code{\link{evaluCATE}} (see the example section below).\cr

To let the function know which observations were used for the CATEs estimation, the user must also provide a logical vector with the \code{TRUE}s denoting observations in the
training sample. This way, \code{\link{evaluCATE}} knows which observations to use to post-process the CATEs estimates.\cr

\code{\link{evaluCATE}} implements a number of strategies to estimate the BLP and the GATES. Most of them involve fitting a suitable linear model. The linear models differ according to the
different identification strategies. Furthermore, for each strategy, there exist various sets of constructed covariates that one can add to reduce the variance of the estimation. \code{\link{evaluCATE}}
fits and returns all these possible models. GATES are also estimated using a nonparametric approach. Check the online
\href{https://riccardo-df.github.io/evaluCATE/articles/evaluCATE-short-tutorial.html}{short tutorial} for details.\cr

For the linear models, standard errors are estimated using the Eicker-Huber-White estimator. These standard errors are then used to test three distinct hypotheses of effect heterogeneity: whether
all GATES are equal to each other, whether the largest and the smallest GATES are different from each other, and whether the differences in the GATES across all pairs of groups are zero.
For the last test, we adjust p-values to account for multiple hypotheses testing using Holm's procedure and report the median of the adjusted p-values. The nonparametric approach tests only the first
of these hypotheses. Check the \href{https://riccardo-df.github.io/evaluCATE/articles/hypotheses-testing.html}{hypotheses testing vignette} for details.\cr

Some of the linear models involve covariates that depend on particular nuisance functions, e.g., propensity score and conditional mean of the outcome
(check the online \href{https://riccardo-df.github.io/evaluCATE/articles/denoising.html}{denoising vignette} for details about these covariates). The user can supply estimates of these functions by using the
optional arguments \code{pscore}, \code{mu}, \code{mu0}, and \code{mu1}. Be careful, as these must be obtained using only the training sample. If not provided by the user, these functions are estimated internally
via honest \code{\link[grf]{regression_forest}}s using only the training sample. \cr

To estimate the BLP and GATES using the AIPW strategy, doubly-robust scores are estimated internally using the validation sample via 5-fold cross fitting and honest regression forests (see the
\code{\link[aggTrees]{dr_scores}} function for details). The same doubly-robust scores are also used to estimate the RATEs.\cr

Groups are constructed by cutting the distribution of \code{cates} into \code{n_groups} quantiles. If this leads to one or more groups composed of only treated or only control units, the function raises an error.\cr

Two different RATEs are estimated: AUTOC and QINI coefficient. Sample-averaging estimators are employed. Standard errors are estimated by the standard deviation of the bootstrap estimates obtained using the half-sample bootstrap.
